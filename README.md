Movie Recommendation System created using Collaborative Filtering (Website) and Content based Filtering (Jupyter Notebook).

### Objectives

To create a movie recommendation system using Collaborative Filtering and machine learning algorithms such as K Nearest Neighbours.The system should recommend movies based on the movie title entered by the user.The system should also be able to recommend movies on the basis of 'genre only' and 'genre and year' entered. The system should apply sentiment analysis to categorize user comments on a particular movie.Additional Content Based Filtering is performed using Neural Network to perform Matrix Factorization.
